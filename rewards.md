You can earn exam grade points (in the form of reduced weight that acts like an insurance against mistakes in the exam) for a Mathematics course by participating in the Infinity Room activities. You can be a presenter or an active participant.
 A *presenter* works on a half an hour activity session with the instructor. This is like a mini research project. It is worth 10 grade points (removing weight from your exam, but not substituting for it).
 A *participant* comes to the event, and works through the activities given by the presenter. Participating is rewarded by 3 grade points.
