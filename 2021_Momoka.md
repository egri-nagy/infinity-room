#### What is your relationship with mathematics? Good, bad? Why?

I used to hate mathematics. When I was in junior high school, I was always saying “Four arithmetic operations are enough. Why do I have to do more?” That negative feeling didn’t come from mathematics itself, it came from my hostility towards adults. My parents and teachers were enemies, and studying was what my enemies forced me to do. 
So, I THOUGHT I hate studying, especially mathematics. Maybe I had an assumption that mathematics is for “well-behaved” students. 
Still, I was smart enough to pass the entrance exam of the top high school in my prefecture. My attitude became worse after entering high school. Unlike mathematics in junior high school, I couldn’t get a good score on the test because I was sleeping during class. I was an inferior student, being in the lowest 10%. After one year since I entered high school, I suddenly got interested in mathematics. I don’t remember the exact trigger that made me start to study mathematics. However, I still remember the moment when I was surprised that a couple of hours have passed without realizing. I even remember that I was studying trigonometric functions with the textbook “Standard”. Then, my relationship with mathematics became the best. I became a top 10% student. 
What changed me was a small thing that I can’t even remember. It has been a mystery for a while, but maybe I got a hint. At the first essay review of Math for Liberal Arts, the professor  said, “In high school, mathematics became more abstract and thus more difficult to understand, so that’s a reason why students may start to hate mathematics”. Maybe I got interested in mathematics because I realized how abstract and interesting it is.

Generally, a bad relationship with mathematics comes from low self-esteem. The biggest and most common cause is getting bad scores on tests. Of course I didn’t score the best because I didn’t study. Still, I didn’t score bad in junior high school. I even have good memories in junior high school. When we had time before the class ended, the math teacher brought additional quizzes. I was the first one to finish them. I remember classmates who were good at math looked surprised and frustrated. Haha. The math teacher of the cram school said to my mother, “Momoka likes to sleep now, but she will do well in high school mathematics.” Hostility against adults was stronger than these good memories. So, I hated mathematics at that time.

After getting along with mathematics (from second year in high school), my experience changed. I don’t feel that I’m “studying” mathematics. I am just having fun. Mathematics is logical. As long as we follow the logic precisely, we will see what we want to see. However, sometimes fun things happen. Even if we follow the logic, we face contradictions. I realized how attractive mathematics is.


#### What is your first encounter with mathematical thinking?

Mathematical thinking is not only about solving math problems but also logical thinking. For example, when we solve puzzles, we use mathematical thinking. So, probably my first encounter with mathematical thinking was when I was one or two years old. My mother gave me a lot of puzzles and I remember two of them. For the very first puzzle, I think I liked chewing it because it was made of sponge. So, my first “mathematical thinking” was to chew the sponge in the most exciting way. Of course, I played in the appropriate way after time had passed. Another puzzle was a block puzzle made of plastic. I forgot when I started playing with that,  but at least I was old enough not to chew it. That block puzzle had instructions so kids can build trucks, robots, and other things that children love. However, I hated that instruction paper and made it into origami. The goal was to find the best form that I can satisfy with. I don’t even know what form I can satisfy with the most, but just looking for that unknown goal was exciting. My first “mathematical thinking without chewing the sponge” was to find the most exciting way to build the block.

#### How does mathematics fit into your career plans?

I am interested in cognitive science, especially from the AI approach. Mathematics is strongly related to it not only in a technical way but also in the way of thinking. When I first learned programming, I thought it was quite similar to mathematics. Especially, when I faced bugs, the thinking process was similar to when I faced issues in mathematics. That thinking process is to follow steps and find where I stepped on the wrong path.
Also, mathematics was actually the cue that made me interested in cognitive science. When I suddenly started to study mathematics in high school, my performance went way better. Everyone, including myself, was surprised with the speed. So, why am I so smart? I mean, how do students learn differently? This was my starting point.

Mathematics already changed my plan significantly. It allowed me to enter AIU. I didn’t know about AIU before the Center test, which was in the middle of January. Originally, I was applying to different universities. I studied hard to get admitted to Waseda University. Second choices were Aoyama Gakuin University, Meiji University, Chuo University. If we score very high (85-90% for those universities/Math+English+Japanese) on the Center test, we can just submit the score and get admitted without taking tests. I wanted to focus on the exam of Waseda, which was in the middle of February, so I decided to get a high score on the Center test. Most of the time, I spent time on mathematics. Successfully, I got 95% on Math 2B. Since I asked a lot of questions to math teachers, I told them that I did well. Then, one of the teachers said that there might be some public universities that I can apply for. Nobody ADDS public universities to options after the Center test. Usually, students REMOVE public universities from the choice, and that happens when students do worse than expected. I thought it’s cool if I add a public university to the choice and pass the exam, so I looked up for universities which I can apply to without science. Finally, the next day of the Center test, I found AIU. I was surprised and decided to apply for AIU not just for fun. Because of the required subjects, I had only one chance. I cleared the requirement for the Center test, which was 90%, but the problem was essays. AIU requires essays in Japanese and English. I haven’t prepared for writing essays, and what’s more, I’m really bad at writing essays. However, having a high score on the Center test made me confident. I don’t know how well I did on the essay, but I passed the exam. 
I am glad that I chose AIU. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary field of study. When I was in high school, I wanted to investigate it from an educational perspective. Now, I’m interested in the computer science approach. If I went to Waseda and majored in educational psychology, I wouldn’t find computer science interesting. If I didn’t score well on Math 2B, this whole story wouldn't happen. Mathematics really means a lot to me.

#### Do you have teaching experience? How did it go?

The first time that I took time for teaching mathematics was when I was in high school. When preparing for entrance exams, I taught mathematics to my friend. Every week, we had time to solve and review previous Center exam problems. I was taking a couple of hours for teaching problems I’ve already solved. If it was other subjects like Geography or English, I wouldn’t have done that. I’ll just ask my friend to ask teachers. However, explaining how to solve math problems was different from explaining about Puszta in Hungary or English sentence structures. I realized that teaching mathematics requires concrete understanding. If I can solve a problem related to Puszta, then I can explain Puszta, and vice versa. Biconditional. On the other hand, Even if I can solve a math problem, it doesn’t mean that I can explain that problem. I continued teaching math until the winter vacation. I scored around 95% in Math 2B, which is quite high. 
Right after graduation, I started my part time job as a tutor at the cram school I went to. That company has schools both in Utsunomiya (my hometown) and Akita. I taught junior high school mathematics in Akita, and high school mathematics in Utsunomiya during vacations. 
I enjoyed these experiences, but the best teaching experience was in the FA 2019. FA19 was a special semester for me, and one of the biggest reasons is the Algebra course. I taught some friends using classrooms in the C building. Classrooms in the C building have whiteboard walls. I drew equations and graphs, and let the friend think and write on the board. Once, I taught three friends in a row, which took seven hours. It wasn’t a burden, just fun. I really miss those days.
Recent teaching experience was at AAC. Since it is online, it was less interactive. I understand Attila says online classes are less interactive and difficult to teach. I always see the reaction of students, and it is difficult to do that online. Still, I learned about a number oftheories which I wasn’t quite sure about.
For me, there were three stages for understanding mathematics. First, I have to learn how it works. Then, solve the problem. This is not the end. At last, I should be able to explain how it works. This is what I was taught by teaching mathematics.

#### What is your favourite part of mathematics?

Everyone thinks that math has one answer, but mathematics doesn’t have an answer. Mathematics is too fragile and incomplete. Even though we learn the definition of “line” in elementary school, we will never be able to see the line itself. What we can see is a finite square with area, not a line. We have to deal with “imaginary” numbers, which is against basic arithmetic rules. We need axioms, which aren't proven. If we remove one axiom from Euclidean Geometry, it will be a different geometry. Godel’s incompleteness theorems say that a consistent formal system is incomplete. Also, it says that no formal system can prove its consistency. I still like this question, “Is mathematics invented or discovered?”. Mathematics cannot answer this question too. I like mathematics because it’s not as perfect as others think.
The answer to the question “Four arithmetic operations are enough. Why do I have to do more?” will be, “No idea. Still, it opened my eyes”. I got interested in programming because I liked mathematics. Since I got interested in programming, I chose Prof. Florent Domenach as my new advisor. I am still in AIU without giving up my interest because of his advice. That will be a different story, but what I want to say is that the interest in mathematics means a lot to me. Mathematics is the foundation of everything. 

Is often said that school mathematics problems have one answer. However, I think it’s the opposite. There is only one result, but there are many solutions. We can take various approaches to solve one problem. As long as solution steps follow the mathematical rules, all approaches are the correct answer. 
My favorite moment is not only when I reach the expected result. I also like an aha moment. When I couldn’t reach the expected result, I read the solution. It takes some time to understand, but there is an aha moment when I get the idea. I’m really addicted to that moment. (Same for programming!)

#### What is your definition of mathematics?

For me, mathematics as an unexplored mountain and studying mathematics is to explore it. When an explorer tries to clear an uncultivated land and reach the summit, he should be careful with each step because the footing is unstable. If he heads the misdirected way, he won’t reach the summit. Same can be said for mathematicians. Mathematicians seek a way to prove the theory which is uncertain, but which they believe is right. They should pay close attention to each step. In spite of careful consideration, if the logic was based on an irrelevant definition, they can’t reach the truth. The meaning is slightly different, but it is the same for students who study mathematics. Students know formulas, which is like a map made by earlier people. However, students have to determine their location and decide which path to take. Students have to find their way by making full use of their knowledge. From mathematicians to students, they are all exploring the mountain. 
This is what I wrote in “me and mathematics” of FA19 Algebra class. The reason why I just copy and pasted isn’t because I’m too lazy. I believe the same thing after two years. 
In terms of this, two years old me was a mathematician. I was trying to reach the summit, which was to create the most exciting way to build the block.
