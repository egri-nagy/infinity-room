#### What is your relationship with mathematics? Good, bad? Why?

Assume mathematics was your neighbor living two houses away from you. I think the neighbor who sometimes let me borrow anything like a bottle of soy sauce would be my relationship with mathematics. I borrowed a lot from mathematics but I have returned back a little. I might have even borrowed without noticing. That is my relationship with mathematics. Mathematics is not only knowledge on many fields, methods, graphics and so on but also playing itself. I read a [small excerpt written by Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) in the college algebra course. In that treatise, Lockhart said mathematics itself is just nothing more than playing. That idea now became my core attitude toward mathematics, but at the time I read first, it was a big finding, or a reminder of what mathematics is. To be honest, my relationship with mathematics would be bad if the world standard to measure it was only scores of exams or something that evaluates me in a lot of values. My score in mathematics is not so good everytime. In spite of it, I love mathematics. Maybe I still need to learn many points to master mathematics as much as I can though, I think this relationship, a little awkward but sometimes kind relationship, will continue for the next ten years unless I become unsatisfied with mathematics.

#### What is your first encounter with mathematical thinking?

I might have encountered mathematical thinking fortunately when I was an elementary school student. However, it was thrown away to oblivion and I might not realize at that time. I often read Wikipedia or some other Internet articles on some mathematical topics.  Foremost I couldn’t understand the meaning of the passages themselves. They included unreadable Japanese characters for me and I remember I first tried to understand what the passages were about. I don’t know what I learned then, but it was a very joyful time for me after I came back to school. But the next clear and vivid opportunity to meet mathematical thinking was recent. I think it was even after I came to AIU here. Although I’ve loved mathematics (and ironically I'm not good at any problem solving), I didn’t understand very much what mathematics is all about. Even though the required specific skills would be different up to mathematical fields, I think the basic idea of mathematics is to show the precise way of generalized ideas. From that perspective, I think the course offered by the university professor was very helpful for me to understand many aspects of mathematics and how to generalize and to solve problems. So my answer became ambiguous though, I think when I found or touched the core philosophy of mathematics is important as well, it would be significant yet as well to re-find that main idea with great explanation by learners themselves.

#### How does mathematics fit into your career plans?

In short, applying to programming or engineering from a broad viewpoint, is a direct way of application of mathematics in my life. If the readers know of me, this answer would be too obvious. Nevertheless, I think other subjects I’m interested in would be best friends with mathematics. For example, I like sociology and linguistics. Both subjects are influenced by mathematical abstraction and structural thinking. One of the evident instances is structuralism. I would often use the similar idea of how mathematical questions expand to abstract thinking as well as structural theorists such as Levi Straus do so. Also, creative writing is one potential object of mathematical thinking. When I make stories, I sometimes pay attention to what mathematical effects including both actual algebraic expressions inside and structural metaphors can be shown in stories. I don't know how it will work since I just started to try that method. However, I hope this indirect application of mathematical thinking would function well.

#### Do you have teaching experience? How did it go?

I remember that I enjoyed teaching others on math problems when I was around second and third grades in an elementary school. I often ended earlier and the teacher allowed those students to finish fast to teach others. That somehow encouraged me to learn mathematics in avance. Nonetheless, after that, I often faced a sense of immaturity when I cannot teach mathematics or even other subjects well. As for mathematics, I don’t have many opportunities to teach it though, I usually teach programming. And honestly, I’m taking the English teacher licensure program courses. Thus, I should teach well, at least English. Despite that, I’ve never taught English before. So, based on what and how I taught programming so far, I often faced miscommunication during some small lectures and classes. This means that I occasionally make assumptions that others cannot understand or simply don’t know. I think one essential part of teaching for others is analyzing the needs of others and simplifying them not by too easy one-way explanation. The continuous contact with others to check points is critically important. Otherwise people might fall into the hole that I experienced when I studied some mathematics in an elementary school.

#### What is your favourite part of mathematics?

I love mathematics, but I often lose my reason why I love mathematics. However, I think one of the reasons is that it is a very pure form of playing, or precisely daydreaming. Since I read some poems written by Sufists, I felt mathematics is a form of simple meditation like dancing my mind in idealistic questions. I like daydreaming. I like taking a walk as well. Both are dignified life activities of any animal, and I think that is what mathematics is. Although I’m not good at speed problem solving nor being a straightforward solver, I just like this daydreaming of mathematical questions. I hope the frequency of how many times I depend on tutorial explanations will be reduced.

#### What is your definition of mathematics?

I think mathematics is just a sequence of meaningful symbols in formal aspects. That meaningful symbols (our friend or enemy of x and the long S for integration) are a metaphorical game of logic as well as daydreaming. Not only that, I think another definition of mathematics would be different notations of another idea. So, mathematics ultimately becomes an ultimately big chain of symbols (maybe more big than the universe, as Vaisheshika scholars thought of the world). Everyday use of equations is just one another form to represent different ideas. Thus, what we use for mathematics including graphs, balls on an elastic mat, chalkboards and so on might be mathematics as well, i.e. different notation for different ideas.
