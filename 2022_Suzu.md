#### What is your relationship with mathematics? Good, bad? Why?

My relationship with mathematics in the past was not good. This was because, in my high school, the mathematics course covered a lot of content. My understanding was slow compared to other students, so I often had classes where I did not understand anything. The worst part was that the teacher at the time did not like questions to be asked during the lecture, and the teacher did not help understand the content. I also felt the peer pressure that I should not be asking too many questions. Therefore, I always thought I was not good at mathematics.

#### What is your first encounter with mathematical thinking?

My first encounter with mathematical thinking was Sudoku. In elementary school, I used to share a sudoku book with one of my classmates and solve straightforward sudoku problems together. I was not comfortable with the textbook's mathematical problems, but sudoku puzzles were entertaining to solve. Now that I think of it, I guess sudoku has only a few rules to remember, which, one of my weakest points in solving math problems is that I cannot remember all the equations or relevant information of math, so I was not stressed not being able to solve them.

#### How does mathematics fit into your career plans?

Currently, I do not have a concrete career plan, but I am interested in accounting. I believe I have to use basic math skills and understand principal mathematical knowledge for accounting. Since I have taken several math classes at AIU, I do not want to distance myself from the math world. Therefore, I would like to somehow connect with math even when I graduate from this school, and considering my possible career choices, pursuing accounting is a reasonable career goal.

#### Do you have teaching experience? How did it go?

Yes. At AIU, I did two Infinity Room sessions, in which I enjoyed explaining and introducing a familiar math topic to my peers. I believe it went well, but by seeing the faces of the participants, I fear that the class was a bit too boring. I tried to make a class as interactive as possible, yet, I mainly talked throughout the course. I want to expand my teaching style, so the participants can move around and potentially solve puzzles or problems with active movements, not just solving on paper.
Before I came to AIU, I also held three classes for elementary and junior high school students. I taught English to non-native speakers. Since the students were young, I included some traditional Japanese games (i.g. Fukuwarai, Karuta) and taught English words through playing games. I realized that students are more engaged and willing to learn English than just reading textbooks. Since the classes' objectives were to engage students to learn English more, I felt using games for learning was very effective.

#### What is your favorite part of mathematics?

My favorite part of mathematics is that through learning it, math made me a more inquiring learner, meaning that I became more willing to tackle complex problems. Since my major is Global Business, I read various news articles about economics. When I was reading the article about the effectiveness of Japanese financial policy, the author used many mathematical equations to predict the outcomes of certain policies. Because I was able to familiarize myself with math during the AIU period, even when I see equations, I do not feel stressed reading the article. Not only that, I try to understand the equations and how they are structured. These attitudes toward math did not come naturally to me. I believe that by learning mathematics, I became a more active learner and became less afraid to challenge myself. Although this answer may not directly answer the question, I feel that my favorite part of math is that it is a subject that can strengthen and train learners.

#### What is your definition of mathematics?

My definition of mathematics is that it is a universal language that can be used to make our life more convenient or explain our world's nature in the most simplistic form. Mathematical formulas and symbols used are the same all over the country so that anyone can understand and join mathematical discussions despite our language barrier. Although beginners have to be explained how each formula works or its significance after people understand the concept, they can explain and prove things only by mathematical symbols.
