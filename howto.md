### How to host a good session?

Most importantly, these sessions are not lectures. In lectures, the audience is often just sitting there, and only a few follow 
the speaker's words.
The easiest way to get the participants involved is by asking them questions. Thus, whatever you want to say, you can turn that 
statement into a question. If you want to say 2+3=5, you can ask what 2+3 is.

Now, this may sound paradoxical. You want to tell the participants something new, but you cannot say it. Instead, you want them to 
say it. But why would they come to the session if they knew the content already? This is not a paradox. This is the crucial point: 
you need to give just enough information, just the right hint, so that they can put it together on their own. By the way, this 
idea is not new. It was invented in ancient Greek philosophy and is called the Socratic method.

When you ask people questions, you cannot predict their answers. This is the point where your familiarity with the topic comes 
into play. The answers will show which way their thinking is going, and you can see whether it is the right one or not. Then you 
can reformulate the question or drop another piece of information.

Growing knowledge is not simply a cumulative process. Sometimes you have to topple some deep-seated beliefs. That is, you need to 
show the audience that they are wrong about something. That is ok. Surprise, the sudden feeling of being wrong about something, 
switches the brain into learning mode.

Knowledge is personal. Everyone has to earn it on their own. A good host simply tries to help that process.

To recap: *a good session plan is a careful selection of questions, not a list of facts on slides*.
