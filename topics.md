# Topic ideas
Here are some ideas for possible topics. These are often broad areas with dozens of possible sessions in each. The list is constantly updated.
 * [Hilbert's hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel) - the signature topic of the Infinity Room is waiting for its first presenter.
 * [Cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) - "message digest" one way functions that form the basis of modern cryptography. Here is a simple fun application: How can I prove that I solved the problem or I know something without actually telling the solution or revealing the information?
 * [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) & [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) - if there is no central bank to oversee the transactions, how can we make sure that no one is double spending? Some mathematics can take care of that.
 * [Knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory) - it might be surprising to many (as it is not part of any standard school curriculum), but there is a mathematical theory of knots. A presentation can have 3d-printed models of knots.
 * [Cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) - visual forms of computation that could very well be in the foundations of our physical universe.
   * [Conway's Game of Life](Conway's Game of Life) 
   * [Rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30) the intiricate patterns of a sea shell explained by very simple rules.
 * Games and puzzles
    *  [Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor) - a game in which winning is literally done by finding a path (both on board and in the game tree). The Infinity Room has boards so a tournament can be organized.
    *  [Rush Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)) simple entertaining puzzle which is actually very hard ([PSPACE-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE-complete))
    *  [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) - an excellent intorduction to the mathematical treatment of [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry)
