### Welcome to the Infinity Room

The Infinity Room is both a physical (a self-access center) and a virtual space (online meetings) designed for experiencing Mathematics in a positive and enjoyable way. Emphasizing the playful, the aesthetic and the mind-blowing aspects, the room is a gateway into collaborative mathematical research with paths leading to other STEM subjects and to a well-rounded liberal art worldview.

You can earn exam grade points for this course by participating in the Infinity Room activities. You can be a presenter or an active participant.
 A *presenter* works on a half an hour activity session with the instructor. This is like a mini research project. It is worth 10 grade points (removing weight from your exam, but not substituting for it).
 A *participant* comes to the event, and works through the activities given by the presenter. Participating is rewarded by 3 grade points.

--------
* July 22, 17:30 *River-crossing puzzles* by Chihiro Ono and Tomoka Yokota. Classic puzzles and their generalizations.[register here](https://forms.gle/ncu4y1HeSsXG14YP7)
* July 22, 18:30 *4x4 Go Puzzles* by Attila Egri-Nagy. Traditional board games are intellectual challenges, but not everyone finds their fighting aspect appealing. In this session, we turn Go, the ancient competitive game, into a series of puzzles. On a miniature 4-by-4 board, the participants will face challenges starting from trivial questions to complex problems. Working through the puzzles leads to an understanding of the essence of Go.  In addition, we will emphasize the meta-cognition aspects of problem solving as well.[register here](https://forms.gle/mmfciDa5Am4AMYZR7)

Then number of sets is limited, enrollment is handled on a first come first served basis. Depending on the demand we may apply an algorithm to maximize the number of students taking part in infinity room events. Enrolment can be done only through an AIU account. Presenters and participants will be sent an email about the information for the online meeting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I want to be a participant, how can I join?**

When the presentations are ready, there will be an announcement and instructions for joining.

**I want to be a presenter, what shall I do?**

Contact your instructor in your Maths  course.

**What happens if my presentation is low quality? Do I still get the points?**

It cannot happen. You will work on the presentation with your instructor. There will be meetings to discuss the content and the way of presentation. Depending on your background, these meetings can be short or a bit longer. In any case, when the presentation is ready, it will be good quality.

**How long is a presentation?**

We plan for 30 minutes long presentations, which may sound long. However, interactive presentations require a lot of time, so this may change.

**I read a book or a paper and I present from that, is this plagiarism?**

 No. Most presentations will be of this type, 'Hey, I read something really mind-boggling, and I want to share it with others!"

**How to pick a topic?**

Anything math-related that interests you. The point is that it should be enjoyable for you to work on it.
