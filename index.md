## Welcome to the Infinity Room

The Infinity Room is both a physical (a self-access center, at the opposite side of LDIC with a special selection of mathematical books that are strictly not textbooks) and a virtual space (online meetings) designed for experiencing Mathematics in a positive and enjoyable way. Emphasizing the playful, the aesthetic and the mind-blowing aspects, the room is a gateway into collaborative mathematical research with paths leading to other STEM subjects and to a well-rounded liberal art worldview.

### Interactive Sessions

During the pandemic the Infinity Room developed its style through the interactive sessions hosted by students. These are 30 minutes long events where the participants can get a clear understanding of an interesting topic or an application. The hosts take special care to prepare interactive tasks instead of merely telling something. In short, the sessions are dedicated to the "art of explanation" (see more on [How to host a session?](howto.md)). Both hosts and participants can get academic [rewards](rewards.md).

## 2021 SPRING EVENTS

* July 6, 20:00 *Welcome to Japanese Mathematics!* by Hinako Ishikawa [register here](https://forms.gle/1VQVcMqGUDa4S5gj8)
* July 9, 10:00 *Shogi Introduction* by Kiwamu Sato on behalf of the AIU Board Game Club [register here](https://forms.gle/Rhe2kBzQ8gxBDLk76)

* July 22, 17:30 *River-crossing puzzles* by Chihiro Ono and Tomoka Yokota. Classic puzzles and their generalizations.[register here](https://forms.gle/ncu4y1HeSsXG14YP7)
* July 22, 18:30 *4x4 Go Puzzles* by Attila Egri-Nagy. Traditional board games are intellectual challenges, but not everyone finds their fighting aspect appealing. In this session, we turn Go, the ancient competitive game, into a series of puzzles. On a miniature 4-by-4 board, the participants will face challenges starting from trivial questions to complex problems. Working through the puzzles leads to an understanding of the essence of Go.  In addition, we will emphasize the meta-cognition aspects of problem solving as well.[register here](https://forms.gle/mmfciDa5Am4AMYZR7)
* July 23, 13:30 *Bayesian Inference* by Yui Sato and Sorana Owatari. [register here](https://forms.gle/qbG36myQfbBw123u8)

Then number of sets is limited, enrollment is handled on a first come first served basis. Depending on the demand we may apply an algorithm to maximize the number of students taking part in infinity room events. Enrolment can be done only through an AIU account. Presenters and participants will be sent an email about the information for the online meeting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I want to be a participant, how can I join?**

When the presentations are ready, there will be an announcement and instructions for joining.

**I want to be a presenter, what shall I do?**

Contact your instructor in your Maths  course.

**What happens if my presentation is low quality? Do I still get the points?**

It cannot happen. You will work on the presentation with your instructor. There will be meetings to discuss the content and the way of presentation. Depending on your background, these meetings can be short or a bit longer. In any case, when the presentation is ready, it will be good quality.

**How long is a presentation?**

We plan for 30 minutes long presentations, which may sound long. However, interactive presentations require a lot of time, so this may change.

**I read a book or a paper and I present from that, is this plagiarism?**

 No. Most presentations will be of this type, 'Hey, I read something really mind-boggling, and I want to share it with others!"

**How to pick a topic?**

Anything math-related that interests you. The point is that it should be enjoyable for you to work on it.
