#### What is your relationship with mathematics? Good, bad? Why?

It was during my college entrance exams that I began to think deeply about mathematics, and it was through introductory problems such as a cubic function that I became interested in the subject.

#### What is your first encounter with mathematical thinking?

I am not sure in detail about the difference between arithmetic and mathematical, but I think that proving formulas in middle school contributed greatly to my mathematical thinking. This means that understanding the process is better than memorizing formulas.

#### How does mathematics fit into your career plans?

Logical thinking was fostered by mathematics, which I believe can be applied to almost any career. I am not sure about my career concretely but I am interested in a career in economics and the math skills will contribute to this largely.

#### Do you have teaching experience? How did it go?

No, but I would like to teach it.

#### What is your favourite part of mathematics?

Number theory. Partly because it seems difficult to solve, once you learn the process of the solution, you are able to be sure of the solution. I like puzzle-like problems the most.

#### What is your definition of mathematics?

I think it is a matter of taking complicated issues, putting them into an abstract concept and developing them afterwards.
