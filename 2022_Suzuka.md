#### What is your relationship with mathematics? Good, bad? Why?

I think I can create a good relationship with math. I have done well in university, only in science and math, and I genuinely enjoy my science and math classes. I like math more than English. English is difficult. One of the difficulties is that learning new languages requires remembering many rules. Use this rule for these situations, but with an exception in this case, and that exception also does not apply in this case... I get overwhelmed by such explanations. Another difficulty is it aims to communicate with other people, so when I use English, I also should consider them. It is tiresome. In contrast, the language of math, numbers, is common in the world, so it is easy to tell others my opinion. I like the simplicity of math. I just have to think intuitively and pursue the answer to the problem.

#### What is your first encounter with mathematical thinking?

Tough question... I was in junior high school and was having some complex problems... I guessâ€¦ DifficultðŸ˜‚ If I had to guess, my first-grade homeroom teacher in junior high school was a math teacher. He is an interesting teacher, and told us many exciting stories about math (almost all were unrelated to the class!) Perhaps it is his influence on my love of mathematics. To begin with, I had been going to cram school (Kumon!) for mathematics since elementary school, so I had a good foundation in mathematics.

#### How does mathematics fit into your career plans?

I am a GB student, and I often use graphs and numbers in economics classes. At those times, I am glad I like mathematics. It is an advantage not to be discouraged when numbers and mathematical symbols appear. Therefore, if I go into the economics field, I also should have a good relationship with math.

#### Do you have teaching experience? How did it go?

I am a tutor (part-time job) and teach math to elementary and middle school students. The more I love my field, the more difficult it is to teach. I like figure problems, but it's hard to explain why I draw a supporting line there, etc. When I should teach the field I like, I always have problems because I cannot understand what students cannot understand! So it is difficult. As I mentioned earlier, teaching mathematics is difficult because it is intuitive, and some questions require a person's sense of the subject. For example, about geometry problems, I think drawing a supporting line really depends on one's sense. I am not confident that I can logically explain how to draw a supporting line. So I always hate it when I tutor in the area of figures!

#### What is your favourite part of mathematics?

Geometry and Probability. Shapes are interesting because they are like puzzles. Probability is interesting because it's a working solution. But I like basically everything. I just do not like areas where I have to memorize formulas. I don't want to memorize math...

#### What is your definition of mathematics?

It is difficult, isnâ€™t it?? Hmmm. It is "A very fun study." I didn't think like this when I was studying for the entrance exam, and I do not think I would have thought this way if I had gone to a science university. Since I am now in a liberal arts university, I am free to some extent from the grades and tests of math, so I think I am genuinely having fun.
