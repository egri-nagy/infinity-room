#### What is your relationship with mathematics? Good, bad? Why?

I think it was good in general since I did enjoy solving mathematical problems, or more like I like to think about something in my head. Also, I feel the beauty of mathematics when I realize that it applies in daily life or explains something in the real world (although it sometimes goes beyond simple mathematics, like computer science, physics, etc.). For example, game theory provides a clear way of thinking about any type of game in which multiple players have to decide based on specific rules. Cryptography explains how to make communication safe, which is something that almost all of us today use every day.  
   
#### What is your first encounter with mathematical thinking?

I believe I first encountered mathematics as a subject through a series of public education lectures beginning in elementary school. However, thinking about when I nurtured mathematical thinking,  it may go back a little more, such as when I play a game or puzzle and the like. 

#### How does mathematics fit into your career plans?
 
I will work as a programmer/product manager related to digital products. Therefore I would use mathematics and learn mathematics to understand the algorithm. For example, to understand computer vision and how computers can process images/videos and identify particular objects, I need to learn the calculation method using matrices and vectors, the mathematical method used in a deep learning model including convolution, and so on.

#### Do you have teaching experience? How did it go?

No, I do not have any experience teaching mathematics.
I think teaching requires a lot of logical reasoning and precise writing/notation and explanation so that the person I teach can better understand the topic. Also, it would be another learning opportunity to recap the subject and ask me, “do I understand this?”. Therefore, the teaching experience would also benefit math skills and understanding. 

#### What is your favorite part of mathematics?

I like the universality of mathematics. Mathematics is unlike natural languages, whose grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and the likes are different; therefore, people cannot communicate if they do not share the same language. We can communicate and transmit the idea because its notation style is not dependent on each region or culture. Like science, mathematics holds true no matter what. 

#### What is your definition of mathematics?

Representation of logic using numbers, figures, symbols, and so on. And I think logic is something that connects different facts/truths or ways of deriving a new fact from known facts.
