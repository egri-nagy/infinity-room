## Server Rules

1. PvP (person versus person) damage is disabled. The game is meant to be a friendly and collaborative space for the players. 

2. **Follow common courtesy.** The same rules apply in the game as in the real world. Please note that these rules are not explicitly listed here, and that's not an excuse.

3. **No griefing**, i.e., deliberately causing grief to fellow players. If you, or a nearby creeper, destroys something that isn't yours, you must fix it to the best of your ability. If you cannot fix it, leave a sign in the game or contact the server admin.

4. **No squatting**, i.e., living in someone else's house. This game is about creating new things, so build your own base. There is ample land available, so if you envy someone else's view, then you can easily get a better one. 

5. **No stealing.** There is a clear difference between a loot box in an abandoned mineshaft (free to take) and a storage chest around someone's well-maintained base. If unsure, please ask.

6. **Protect your property.** Protector blocks can be crafted. They can prevent anyone, except the owner(s), from interacting with the blocks in a cube with the protector in the center. In combination with protected doors, you can have reasonably good protection for your items. At least put a sign on your stuff.

7. **Privacy policy:** The server logs every action of all users, and this may be used in future student projects (e.g., in Statistics reports). It is not required to use your real name in the game. When the account is authenticated (when you get the interaction right), your AIU email is linked to the game ID but stored separately, and it does not appear in server logs. This linked record will only be used in the case of wrongdoing.
